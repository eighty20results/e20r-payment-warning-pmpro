= Known Issues =

The "Add Media" button when adding a new template in the E20R Template editor is a little troublesome and may required extra clicks to close/update.

The "Text" window in the E20R Template Editor is mis-sized (doesn't fill the full width of the Visual editor).

The "Credit Card Expiration" messages will not get sent/processed (upcoming feature).

The plugin currently supports the Stripe.com payment gateway. Adding more gateways is on the roadmap, but will require sponsorships. You can sponsor support for a new gateway by going to (The Eighty / 20 Results Shopping page)[link="https://eighty20results.com/shop"] and purchase a sponsorship. When you sponsor the development of gateway support you will receive support for life, plus a lifetime license to the E20R Payment Warning for PMPro plugin.
