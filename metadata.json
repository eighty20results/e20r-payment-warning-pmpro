    "description" : "<p>Generates and sends notices to active Paid Memberships Pro members about their upcoming recurring payment, their expiring memberships, and required updates to their credit card information. The plugin receives its data directly from the supported payment gateway which makes it more reliable and consistent in sending email warnings/notices to your members.</p><p>Being more reliable and up-to-date notification system than the standard Recurring Payment Email Reminder add-on for Paid Memberships Pro, the E20R Payment Warning for PMPro plugin will utilize the most recent information generated by the payment gateway itself, rather than rely on disconnected data stored on your local WordPress site. <a href=\"https://eighty20results.com/wordpress/paid-memberships-pro/payment-gateways/\" target=\"_blank\">Note that the Paid Memberships Pro does NOT store the payment data locally on your web server</a></p>",
